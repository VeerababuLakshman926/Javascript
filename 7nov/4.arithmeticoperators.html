            console.log(a+c+b); //103020
            console.log(c+b+a); //302010 starting c is string so it will concat the next variables also
            console.log(a - c); //-20 here '-' has no any concatination. so it will convert the string c into a number i.e, 30 and the output will be 10-30=-20
            console.log(a-d); //here d cant be converted into a number because there is 's'. so it will give output as NaN(NOT a NUMBER).
